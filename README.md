### Doctor Appointment Show/No Show Analysis in Python

I am using Python for reading the data, cleaning, understanding the features, visualizing and trying to see if we can predict whether a person will show-up for a medical appointment or not from the given set of dataset.


Here's the doctor appointments dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/home


Please go to the Jupyter Notebook file to view my analysis on this dataset.
